# LESSONS — field failures that made the kit better

Append-only, newest first. Every entry = a bug the kit hit in a real repo, fixed at the source per the Self-repair protocol in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Read the two most recent entries before an install — they are the freshest sharp edges.

Format: `## L-xxx — <one-line symptom>` · date · repo · Root cause · Fix · Harness.

## L-003 — tasklog-check spams `fatal: path ... does not exist` on every run against a young baseline

- **Date:** 2026-07-23 · **Repo:** sale-visit-system (first install)
- **Symptom:** every checker run printed 4-7 `fatal:` lines to stderr even when green — files new since the upstream baseline (gwork.json, task-log/*) make `showAt(ref, path)` probe refs that don't have them. Harmless but it reads like a failure and buries real errors.
- **Root cause:** `git()` helper used `execSync` default stdio → child stderr inherited. The `catch { return null }` already treats a miss as expected, but the noise still leaked.
- **Fix:** `stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'ignore']` in the `git()` helper (`scripts/tasklog-check.mjs`) — expected-miss lookups are silent; real failures still surface as check errors.
- **Harness:** e2e unit 15/15 pass after change · green run verified in the repo (0 fatal lines).

## L-002 — install silently loses the checker when the target repo gitignores `/scripts/`

- **Date:** 2026-07-23 · **Repo:** sale-visit-system (first install)
- **Symptom:** `git add scripts/tasklog-check.mjs` → "paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files". Repo had `/scripts/` ignored (its own temp-script convention). Without noticing, the kit would run locally but break for every clone/CI.
- **Root cause:** install steps assumed `scripts/` is trackable. Extra trap: adding `!/scripts/tasklog-check.mjs` under `/scripts/` does nothing — git never descends into a fully-excluded directory, so negations inside are dead.
- **Fix:** install step 2 now requires `git check-ignore` on the copied paths; the documented remedy is `/scripts/*` (ignore contents, not the dir) + `!` negations for the kit files.
- **Harness:** not code — instruction fix in SKILL.md step 2.

## L-001 — migrate.mjs parses 0 entries from a CRLF legacy log

- **Date:** 2026-07-23 · **Repo:** sale-visit-system (first install)
- **Symptom:** `node scripts/migrate.mjs "update task.md"` → `parsed 0 entries`, empty INDEX, no error. The 4,400-line log clearly had 196 `## YYYY-MM-DD` headers.
- **Root cause:** file was CRLF; `raw.split('\n')` leaves `\r` on every line, and in JS regex `.` does not match `\r` (it's a LineTerminator) — so the header regex's `(.*)$` failed on every single header. Silent because 0 matches is a legal outcome.
- **Fix:** `split(/\r?\n/)` in `scripts/migrate.mjs` (with a why-comment). Any future kit script that splits file lines must use `/\r?\n/`.
- **Harness:** migrate.mjs is not covered by e2e (stated per protocol step 4) — verified by re-running the real migration: 196 entries, 3 shards, INDEX 144 modules.
